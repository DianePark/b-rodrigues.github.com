Hi! My name is Bruno Rodrigues, and I'm a senior Data Scientist at [PwC Luxembourg](https://www.pwc.lu/). 
I mostly work on data related projects using R and Python.

I'm an economist by training, I hold a PhD from the University of Strasbourg, 
but am interested in any subject that deals with statistics in general!

I program mostly in R and love sharing my knowledge, that's why I started this blog.
I share my posts also on [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com) and [Rweekly](https://rweekly.org). 
In my posts, I discuss new packages I discovered or new ways of using packages.

If you were one of my students, and need some of the materials I taught, just drop me an [email](mailto:bruno@brodrigues.co).

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/brodriguesco) for blog updates.

I'm writing a book as a hobby about functional programming, unit testing and package
development with R. You can read it for [free](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/).

You can also download my package, called [brotools](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/brotools),
which contains some functions I use daily. You might find them useful too! I also made a package
called `{nethack}` that contains data from NetHack games played online from 2001 to 2018. You
can get it [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nethack).
