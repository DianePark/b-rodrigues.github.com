### [Version Control Systems to Facilitate Research Collaboration in Economics](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-015-9513-8), in Computational Economics, 2015


*Abstract*

Reliable and reproducible research is an important cornerstone of science, and version control systems not only make reproducible research possible in a rapid and easy way, but also provide a way of collaborating with co-authors. 
The purpose of this methodological paper is to present Git, a very successful version control system and how it can be used by economists working together on their papers and the accompanying computer code. 
Version control systems also make sharing the findings with the rest of the scientific community more easy and streamlined. 
To understand how version control systems came to be, one must be familiar with the history of free software. 
In the introduction, I will present free software and its philosophy and show how version control systems make free software possible. 
In the second section I present Git which is a widely used version control system. In the third section I show a basic usage of Git. In the fourth section, I conclude.

*Abstract* 

Previous studies have shown that childrearing has a different impact on a mother’s
professional career, depending, among other reasons, on how much time passed from birth to return
to work. In this paper, we use a competing risks model to determine which variables may explain
time out of work, as well as the transition back to work for young mothers in France. In our study,
mothers can decide to go back to the same employer, change a personal but also a
professionalemployer and/ or change labour supply. Our results show that it is mostly the age of
the mothers at birth, their pre-birth wages, tenure, ﬁrm size as well as the state of the economy
as a whole that play a large role in the way young mothers go back to work, if at all. This
research highlights the key factors on which causal research should be based in order to advise
ﬁrms and also policy-makers on how to inﬂuence mothers’ labour supply behaviors.

### [The birth of a child and its impact on wages and worked hours: evidence from France](http://www.beta-umr7522.fr/productions/publications/2016/2016-48.pdf), 2016, with Vincent Vergnat


*Abstract*

Using French administrative data, we estimate the impact of the birth of a first child on hourly and daily wages, as well as for hours worked, for both women and men. 
We compute the impact on these outcome variables, two, four and eight years after the birth of the child, using difference-in-differences.
We compare the impact for different education levels of both mothers and fathers. The results show that in the short term there is no impact of a birth on wages and hours worked but eight years after
the birth of a child, highly educated women suffer from a loss in daily and hourly wages as well as hours worked. 
Educated men also decrease their labour supply.
