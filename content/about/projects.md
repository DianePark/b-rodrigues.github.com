## Modern R with the Tidyverse 

Modern R with the tidyverse is an [ebook](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/) that was 
initially based on notes I used when I taught R at university, and later to my colleagues at my
different jobs. My aim with this ebook is to provide an in-depth introduction to the R programming
language and the libraries of the tidyverse.
If you like it, and want to contribute to the hosting costs of this website, you can purchase a copy 
at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modern_tidyverse). The book is still being written, but is mostly 
complete.

## My youtube channel

I also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZXht1RTL2Duc3eU8MYGzQ), 
where I show some tips and tricks with R, or rant about stuff.

## My Github repositories

You can find my Github repositories [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues?tab=repositories) where
you can find code from my blog posts, some repositories that I forked and also the source code
of my `{brotools}` package and `{michelRodange}` package.
