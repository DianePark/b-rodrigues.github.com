This blog post shows how to make bar plots and area charts. It's mostly a list of recipes, indented 
for myself. These are plots I have often to do in reports and would like to have the code handy 
somewhere. Maybe this will be helpful to some of you as well. Actually, this post is exactly how
I started my blog post. I wanted to have a repository of recipes, and with time the blog grew to
what it is now (tutorials and me exploring methods and datasets with R).

## Bar charts

Bar charts are quite simple plots, but there are enough variations of them that they deserve
one single blog post. However, don't expect many explanations.

Let's first start by loading some data, and the usually required packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(colorspace)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(colorspace)
```

```{r}
data(gss_cat)
```

Very often, what one wants to show are counts:

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  count(marital, race)
```

Let's lump marital statuses that appear less than 10% of the time into an "Other" category:

```{r}
(
  counts_marital_race <- gss_cat %>%
    mutate(marital = fct_lump(marital, prop = 0.1)) %>%
    count(marital, race)
)
```

The simplest bar plot:

```{r}
ggplot(counts_marital_race) +
  geom_col(aes(x = marital, y = n, fill = race)) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog()
```

Now with `position = "dodge"`:

```{r}
ggplot(counts_marital_race) +
  geom_col(aes(x = marital, y = n, fill = race), position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog()
```

Moving the legend around with `theme(legend.position = ...)`:

```{r}
ggplot(counts_marital_race) +
  geom_col(aes(x = marital, y = n, fill = race), position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() +
  theme(legend.position = "left")
```

Counting by year as well:

```{r}
(
  counts_marital_race_year <- gss_cat %>%
    mutate(marital = fct_lump(marital, prop = 0.1)) %>%
    count(year, marital, race) %>%
    ungroup()
)
```

When you want to show how a variable evolves through time, area chart are handy:

```{r}
counts_marital_race_year %>%
  group_by(year, marital) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = marital)) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

Now with facets:

```{r}
counts_marital_race_year %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

But what if I want each plot to have its own y axis?

```{r}
counts_marital_race_year %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

Now doing an area chart but with relative frequencies:

```{r, fig.height = 4}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

With `facet_wrap()`:

```{r, fig.height = 10}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(race, year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

Want to replace 2000 with "2000-01-01"? First need to create vector of prettier dates and positions:

```{r}
pretty_dates <- counts_marital_race_year %>%
  mutate(pretty_dates = paste0(year, "-01-01")) %>%
  pull(pretty_dates) %>%
  unique()

position_dates <- counts_marital_race_year %>%
  pull(year) %>%
  unique() %>%
  sort() 
```

`scale_x_continuous()` can now use this. Using `guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)` to avoid 
overlapping labels:

```{r, fig.height = 10}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(race, year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_continuous("Year of survey", labels = pretty_dates,
                     breaks = position_dates, guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

Adding labels is not trivial. Here it is not working:

```{r, fig.height = 10}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(race, year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_continuous("Year of survey", labels = pretty_dates,
                     breaks = position_dates, guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  geom_label(aes(x = year, y = freq, label = round(100 * freq))) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

Another failed attempt. I leave it here for posterity.
My first idea was first to sort the grouped data set by descending frequency, and then 
to reorder the factor variable `marital` by descending position, which is the cumulative percentage.
This would work fine, if the same factor levels would have had the same order for each of the 
race categories. However, this is not the case. For blacks, the most frequent category is "Never Married".
As you can see below, this trick worked well for 2 categories out of 3:

```{r, fig.height = 10}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(race, year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>%
  group_by(year, race) %>%  
  arrange(desc(freq)) %>% 
  mutate(position = cumsum(freq)) %>% 
  mutate(marital = fct_reorder(marital, desc(position))) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous("Year of survey", labels = pretty_dates,
                     breaks = position_dates, guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  geom_label(aes(x = year, y = position, label = round(100 * freq))) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

So to remedy this, is not reorder too early; first, we need to reorder the factor variable by 
frequency. Then, we arrange the data by the now reordered `marital` variable, and then we can 
compute the position using the cumulative frequency.

```{r, fig.height = 10}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(race, year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>%
  group_by(year, race) %>%  
  mutate(marital = fct_reorder(marital, freq)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(marital)) %>% 
  mutate(position = cumsum(freq)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous("Year of survey", labels = pretty_dates,
                     breaks = position_dates, guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  geom_label(aes(x = year, y = position, label = round(100 * freq))) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

We can place the labels a bit better (in the middle of their respective areas), like so:

```{r, fig.height = 10}
counts_marital_race_year %>% 
  group_by(race, year, marital) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%  
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>%
  group_by(year, race) %>%  
  mutate(marital = fct_reorder(marital, freq)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(marital)) %>% 
  mutate(position = cumsum(freq)) %>% mutate(prev_pos = lag(position, default = 0)) %>%
  mutate(position = (position + prev_pos)/2) %>%  
  ggplot() +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = marital)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), ncol = 1, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous("Year of survey", labels = pretty_dates,
                     breaks = position_dates, guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) +
  geom_label(aes(x = year, y = position, label = round(100 * freq))) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

Now let's focus on the variable `tvhours`. We want to show the total watched hours, but also 
the total across all the categories of `race` and `marital` in a faceted bar plot:

```{r}
(
  total_tv <- gss_cat %>%
    group_by(year, race, marital) %>%
    summarise(total_tv = sum(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE))
)
```

This tibble has the total watched hours by year, race and marital status variables. How to add the total
by year and race categories? For this, by are first going to use the `group_split()`:

```{r}
total_tv_split <- total_tv %>%
  select(race, year, marital, total_tv) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%  
  group_split(year, race)
```

I have to re-order the columns with `select()`, because when using `janitor::adorn_totals()`, which 
I will be using below to add totals, the first column must be a character column (it serves as 
an identifier column).

This creates a list with 3 races times 6 years, so 24 elements. Each element of the list is a tibble
with each unique combination of year and race:

```{r}
length(total_tv_split)
total_tv_split[1:2]
```

Why do this? To use `janitor::adorn_totals()`, which adds row-wise totals to a data frame, or to 
each data frame if a list of data frames gets passed to it. I need to still transform the data a little
bit. After using `adorn_totals()`, I bind my list of data frames together, and then fill down the year 
column (when using `adorn_totals()`, character columns like `year` are filled with `"-"`, but I chose
to fill it with `NA_character_`). I then replace the NA value from the marital column with the 
string `"Total"` and then reorder the `marital` column by value of `total_tv`:

```{r}
total_tv_split <- total_tv_split %>%
  adorn_totals(fill = NA_character_) %>%
  map(as.data.frame) %>%  
  bind_rows() %>%
  fill(year, .direction = "down") %>%
  mutate(marital = ifelse(is.na(marital), "Total", marital)) %>%
  mutate(marital = fct_reorder(marital, total_tv))
```

I can finally create my plot. Because I have added "Total" as a level in the `marital` column, it
now appears seamlessly in the plot:

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
ggplot(total_tv_split) +
  geom_col(aes(x = marital, y = total_tv, fill = race)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(year), nrow = 2) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 3)) +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```

To finish this list of recipes, let's do a pyramid plot now (inspiration from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680075/simpler-population-pyramid-in-ggplot2):

```{r}
data_pyramid <- gss_cat %>%
  filter(year == "2000", marital %in% c("Married", "Never married")) %>%
  group_by(race, marital, rincome) %>%  
  summarise(total_tv = sum(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(data_pyramid, aes(x = rincome, y = total_tv, fill = marital)) +
  geom_col(data = filter(data_pyramid, marital == "Married")) +
  geom_col(data = filter(data_pyramid, marital == "Never married"), aes(y = total_tv * (-1))) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(race), nrow = 1, scales = "free_x") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative(palette = "Dark 3") +
  brotools::theme_blog() 
```
